## What is it?

- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system.
- Git helps us keep track of the changes to our source code over the lifespan of a project.
- When combined with cloud version control sites like GitHub or GitLab, we can use git to collaborate with others remotely.

## Why Git?

- With Git, you can make a "commit", or a save point, as often as you'd like.
- You can also go back to previous commits. This takes the pressure off of you while you're working.
- Commit often and commit early, and you'll never have that gut sinking feeling of overwriting or losing changes.
- Allows us to work offline if necessarily and synchronize with a distributed team.

## Why Not Git?

 #### Downsides to working with git in game development:
- Not especially user friendly for non-developers.
- No built-in support for large repos, although the Git LFS add-on exists.
- No built-in support for locking binary assets. (Locking can be enabled with Git LFS.)
