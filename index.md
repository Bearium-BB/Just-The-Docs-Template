## What is Version Control?

- **Version control**, also known as **revision control** or **source control**, is the management of changes to documents like computer programs.

- CTRL-Z is the simplest form of version control.

## More Than Just Undo

Version control allows for more than just undoing things:
- Work on new projects features while at the same time patching bugs found in older version of the code.
- Collaborate with someone on a projects without overwriting each other's work.
- Work with distributed teams of coders from around the world to develop open-source applications.

## Evolution of Version Control

**A Diary Analogy**:

- **Local Version Control:** Storing your diary under your pillow.
- **Centralized Version Control:** Storing a copy of your diary in a safety deposit box.
- **Distributed Version Control:** Making mulitiple copies to store with trusted friends.

## Why Should I Care About Version Control?
- Solo or team, version control is your secret weapon for efficient and stress-free software development.

**It's your development safety net!**

## Different Version Control Systems

**Distributed VCS**
- Git - Free. Popular outside of game dev, especially for open source project.
- Plastic SCM / Unity Version Control - Paid. Now owned by Unity.

**Centralized VCS**
- Perforce Helix Core - Paid. Industry standard for large game dev shops.
- Subversion - Free. Classic choice for smaller / indie shops.

# Git

Learn what Git is and the pros and cons of using it. 

## What is Git?

- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system.
- Git helps us keep track of the changes to our source code over the lifespan of a project.
- When combined with cloud version control sites like GitHub or GitLab, we can use git to collaborate with others remotely.

## Why Git?

- With Git, you can make a "commit", or a save point, as often as you'd like.
- You can also go back to previous commits. This takes the pressure off of you while you're working.
- Commit often and commit early, and you'll never have that gut sinking feeling of overwriting or losing changes.
- Allows us to work offline if necessarily and synchronize with a distributed team.

## Why Not Git?

**Downsides to working with git in game development**
- Not especially user friendly for non-developers.
- No built-in support for large repos, although the Git LFS add-on exists.
- No built-in support for locking binary assets. (Locking can be enabled with Git LFS.)
